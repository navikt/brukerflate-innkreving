# Project Guidelines for Brukerflate Innkreving

## Project Overview
Brukerflate Innkreving is a web application developed by NAV (Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration) for debt collection management. The application allows users to search for debtors (skyldnere) by national ID number (f√∏dselsnummer) or organization number (orgnummer) and view details about their claims/debts (krav).

## Project Structure
- `/app` - Main application code
  - `/components` - Reusable UI components
  - `/routes` - Route definitions using TanStack Router
  - `/server` - Server-side code and API endpoints
  - `/types` - TypeScript type definitions
  - `/queries` - API query definitions
- `/test` - Test files

## Technology Stack
- React 19 with TypeScript
- TanStack libraries (Router, React Query, React Form)
- TanStack Start as the meta-framework (with Vinxi as a dependency)
- NAV's design system (@navikt/ds-react, @navikt/ds-css)
- Zod for schema validation

## Development Guidelines
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Run `npm run build` to build the project for production
- Run `npm run start` to start the production server

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use NAV's design system components for UI elements
- Use Zod for data validation
- Follow the established project structure for new features

## Testing
When implementing changes, ensure that the application's core functionality remains intact:
- Debtor search functionality
- Claim details display
- Navigation between different views
